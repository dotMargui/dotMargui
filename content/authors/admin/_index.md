I'm a lawyer based in Lisbon, Portugal taking my first steps with basic programming skills. I'm interested in privacy rights and bettering citizens' lives through the implementation of IT by public agencies and bodies, both national and European. In my blog you'll find some thoughts regarding my area of research, as well as posts pertaining to my other interests, such as traditional and healthy cooking, fitness, history, and music.
